Stakeholder: Dean (Future Rocketry Team Leader) / Sachin Hanel

Dean:
    The gui may need to handle tracking multiple rockets at once. Need to discuss this with Adi.

Sachin:
    Need to consider what is involved in recieving information from both 433 & 915 radios at once. Might need to have instances of both at once.
