    Coding rate (int - pending confirmation)
    Frequency (float)
    Power Level (float)
    Bandwidth (float)
    Channel (int)

Status Tab:
    Radio status should have both whether its connected and whether its active/healthy
    IBIS FSM Status should be the current state reported out of x states
    Charge continuite should be a binary graph over Time
    For flight data we should have customisable graphs able to be added for each telemetry catgeory

Telemetry Tab:
    There should be a panel for the current values of each telemetry value
    Potentially put customisable graphs here (more than likely)

Maps Tab:
    Add in radar map
    Either a list of radar maps and depending on where we add in out gps location it chooses from the list
    Show the relative location of rocket

Logs:
    Remove the battery warning
    Should be just a moving text portal that scrolls straight to the bottom showing all the text reported

Notifications:
    Most of the time we will be on the telemetry tab looking at the custom graphs
    We should  have notifications arise anywhere when any of the following change: 
        IBIS FSM Status 
        Charge Continuity (need algorithm for determining this)
        Radio Status - either
        Low battery

Historical Logs:
    This will basically just be a tab that is a file explorer and allows us to access the storage and open any previous logs

Customisation:
    Later down the track timone should be developed to be ready for additional devices (sensors) to be plugged in
    There will be a list of device types that the system is prepared to handle
    When a new device is added the gui should recognise what device type it is by id and arise the functionality to handle it inclusion
    There should be an API created later that would allow users to create a custom id for their device and customise how it will interact with the gui
